          <p class="biotext" >SETTWOR is a music producer specializing in phonk, Brazilian funk, and dance/electronic music. Originally from Kryvyi Rih, Ukraine, he relocated to Poland in 2022. He is best known for his musical works, YouTube channel, and short TikTok videos featuring his tracks.<br><br>

          SETTWOR is one of the actively streamed phonk artists on Pandora, where his tracks consistently gain plays and continue to attract new listeners.</p>

          <h1 class="socnettext">Biography</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="strip"></div>
        <div class="biotextdiv">
          <p class="biotext">SETTWOR was born on February 8, 2007, in Kryvyi Rih, Ukraine. Daniil was very interested in programming and immersed himself in an in-depth study of programming languages. After years of programming, Daniil became interested in music, so in 2018 he began studying music and, having gained some knowledge, released his first track “Light Wave” in 2021.<br><br>

          In 2020, Daniil took the pseudonym SETTWOR and created a YouTube channel of the same name for his work and future music. On May 8, 2022, the artist's first track in the phonk genre - Lunatic - was released.<br><br>

          From 2021 through 2025, SETTWOR steadily developed his musical skills, gradually gaining experience and releasing an increasing number of tracks. During this period, he published music with little to no established audience, focusing primarily on learning and refining his sound. Phonk remained the main genre of his releases at the time.<br><br>

          On February 9, 2023, SETTWOR released the track GOT ME UP. Later, with the release of the album GET IT, Vol.1, and having gained more experience and technical knowledge, he presented an updated version titled GOT ME UP 2, which served as a refined and improved reinterpretation of the original track. Over time, GOT ME UP 2 became the most successful release in SETTWOR’s career, standing out significantly in terms of streaming numbers compared to his other works.<br><br>

          On December 15, 2023, the release of DON'T STOP marked the first major turning point in SETTWOR’s artistic development. The track differed noticeably from his earlier phonk-oriented releases and introduced a new direction in his sound. Following this release, SETTWOR continued working with phonk, but with changes in style and production approach, shifting his focus primarily toward album projects rather than standalone singles. From this point on, experimentation with various musical styles became a defining aspect of his work and remains so to this day.<br><br>

          Before releasing his mixtape BREAKPOINT Mixtape on March 28, 2025, SETTWOR made the decision to promote his tracks more actively than ever before. He also hinted at a possible departure from the phonk genre - either partially or completely - to explore new musical directions. As planned, the release of BREAKPOINT Mixtape marked a true turning point in his career, signaling a shift in style and a move toward different sounds. Currently, he is working on tracks that lean more toward Brazilian funk, house and EDM.<br><br>

          The mixtape truly became a breaking point. Shortly after its release, the track GOT ME UP 2 from his previous album GET IT, Vol.1 reached a record number of streams in SETTWOR’s history - and it continues to grow. More and more of his songs are gaining attention, streams, and playlist placements.<br><br>

          On September 26, 2025, SETTWOR released an aggressive, fast-paced bass track titled OG KILLIN'. The song captures the raw essence of old-school true phonk in its prime — the very sound that made fans fall in love with the genre — serving as a tribute to legendary and authentic phonk.<br><br>

          Unexpectedly, the track reached record-breaking streaming numbers for SETTWOR within the first few days after its release, showing that listeners still have a strong interest in the classic old-school phonk sound.<br><br>

          On December 12, 2025, SETTWOR released NOITE SELVAGEM, his first track in the Brazilian funk genre. The release marks a new creative chapter in his musical journey and highlights his interest in exploring different sounds and styles.<br><br>

          In late 2025, SETTWOR developed an interest in Brazilian funk and released two tracks in this style. The beginning of 2026 also focused on funk, which remained the only genre he released until spring. According to the artist, this period was intended to test Brazilian funk with his audience. At the same time, SETTWOR stated that he does not plan to fully transition into the genre, viewing it strictly as an experiment, as Brazilian funk does not align with his core musical direction.</p>

          <p class="biotext">On April 3, 2025, SETTWOR’s track “GOT ME UP 2” from the album GET IT, Vol.1 reached 100,000 streams on Pandora, becoming one of his most notable achievements at the time. A few months later, on July 22, 2025, the same track surpassed 500,000 streams on the platform, marking a major milestone in SETTWOR’s career. The song continues to grow steadily, showing strong listener interest and replay value over time.<br><br>

          In its first week after release, the track PIT STOP became the fastest-growing release in SETTWOR’s history in terms of streams, setting a new personal record for the artist.</p></div>

        <div class="biotextdiv">
          <p class="biotext">SETTWOR’s YouTube channel showed steady and impressive growth over the years. On August 7, 2022, the channel reached its first 1,000 subscribers, and by October 2, 2022, it had already surpassed 1 million total views. Less than a year later, on June 11, 2023, the subscriber count jumped to 10,000, while total views hit 5 million by May 24, 2023. Continuing the momentum, SETTWOR achieved 15,000 subscribers on April 15, 2024, and crossed 10 million views on July 9, 2024 — solidifying his presence as a recognized creator in the music scene.<br><br>

          The SETTWOR channel features over 600 videos, including edits of various tracks in different styles such as 8D audio, slowed, sped up, a few mashups, as well as SETTWOR’s own original songs.<br><br>

          On November 2, 2022, SETTWOR received the status of an official musician's channel.<br><br>

          On June 13, 2023, the day before the channel’s third anniversary, YouTube deleted the channel for an unknown reason, as SETTWOR reported on his social media. On the same day, after filing an appeal, the channel was restored; the reason for the removal was quite strange. SETTWOR wrote in his Telegram channel:</p></div>

        <div class="biotextdiv" style="padding: 0px 0px 15px 0px">
          <p class="biotext quote">"They deleted the channel for 'Sveta Kakala Skazhi', or rather for the guy who was shaking his ass at the beginning. They said it was sexual content that causes arousal. For some reason, they deleted the channel, although they should have issued a warning first, and only after four warnings should they have deleted it. After restoring the channel, they gave me a warning and deleted the video. I filed an appeal to restore the video; it was restored but marked as 18+."</p></div>

        <div class="biotextdiv" style="padding: 15px 0px 20px 0px">
          <p class="biotext">On October 11, 2025, the SETTWOR channel was hacked, and scammers gained control of the account. The following day, the hackers sold the channel. Three days after the incident, on October 14, 2025, SETTWOR successfully recovered his channel and account with the help of YouTube support.</p></div>
